Genuinely, Koudelka looks brilliant and feels very ahead of its time. Unfortunately, this comparison only further makes Shadow Hearts look utterly juvenile and dull. I know it's nostalgic and beloved by people who grew up with it, but I find it hard to be charitable towards it when it doesn't have anything that isn't over-done and drastically improved-on by its contemporaries.Yuri is just the most stock "200X angsty anime protagonist" fighting a physicalised personification of his own angst; an archetype portrayed far better, and even sometimes worse, in countless other pieces of media that came out around it.
